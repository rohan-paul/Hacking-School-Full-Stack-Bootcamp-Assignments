9’s complement of a decimal number is the subtraction of it’s each digits from 9. 9’s complement is used to subtract a number from another number using addition process. Look at the above link to see the example.

Given a decimal number n, find 9’s complement of the number.

Input : 25
Output : 9's complement is : 74

Input : 345.45
Output : 9's complement is : 654.54
********************************************************************

PROBLEM STATEMENT AT TECHOLUTION - write a program to find the sum of 9's complement of each digit of the given input.

Example; input = 104
output = 22
*/

nineComplementSum = num => {

  let numStrArr = num.toString().split('');

  let nineComplementNum = [];

  for (let i of numStrArr) {
    nineComplementNum.push(9 - parseInt(i) );
  }
  // note, the for...in syntax will take the index value of 0, 1, 2... for 'i' and  for...of syntax will take the element itself

  return nineComplementNum.reduce((accum, currentItem) => {
    return accum + currentItem;
  }, 0)
}

console.log(nineComplementSum(104));

Now coming to 10's complement, it is relatively easy to find out the 10's complement after finding out the 9,s complement of that number. We have to add 1 with the 9's complement of any number to obtain the desired 10's complements.

If 9's complement is 543 then 10's complement of this no 544

"complement (noun) - A number that when added to another number of the same sign yields zero if the significant digit farthest to the left is discarded "
