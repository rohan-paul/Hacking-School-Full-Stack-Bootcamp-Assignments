/* Problem statement -
I have 2 2-d arrays and the matrixAddition() function should return their addition. Like so,
matrixAddition( [ [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1,], [1, 1, 1] ], [ [2, 2, 1], [3, 2, 3], [1, 1, 3] ] );
returns [ [3, 4, 4], [6, 4, 4], [2, 2, 4] ]

Note that each of the arguments to the matrixAddition () function is two dimensional arrays of equal height and width (n)

For Matrix Visualization see how the 2 2-D Arrays in LHS added up to give the result on RHS
|1 2 3|   |2 2 1|   |3 4 4|
|3 2 1| + |3 2 3| = |6 4 4|
|1 1 1|   |1 1 3|   |2 2 4|

Also note that the lengths of the 2 2-d arrays are same. i.e arr1.length == arr2.length in the below problem.

Basically, to do matrix addition simply add up the values inside the inner-array-1 with the corresponding values found on the inner-Array-2.

function matrixAddition1 (arr1, arr2) {

  let result = []; // the final output which is also a 2-d array

  for (var i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {

    // set this first element of the resulting array to be an empty array, and I am going to fill this index position up with the next lines of codes. And if I dont declare it here, then will get "TypeError: Cannot set property '0' of undefined" because because I am trying to assign an array element to a variable without first declaring it to be any array.

/* Further notes on the above
A> First, I am looping through the first depth of the outer 2dArray arr1, which values are also arrays.
B> The first argument numItem in arr1.forEach is the value of the current index in the outer 2d Array arr1. The argument index1 is an index of 2dArray arr1 where the value numItem is found.
C> We can use index1 to reference the corresponding inner array on 2dArray arr2 from the inner iteration arrItem.forEach and use the arrItem.forEach index argument which I labeled index2 to reference the numbers in 2dArray b by reading arr2[index1][index2].

/*
A> With Array.reduce we just need to keep in mind the signature change which becomes (callback, initialValue) where callback is our function to run against each value of array arrElem and the callback has parameters (previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array)

The forEach() - here its callback works on the element of the outer array, each callback is applied on an array itself.

And the reduce() - here its callback works on each element of the inner array, hence the callback is applied on individual numbers.

B> Here for the reduce() function the initial value of sums is an empty array.

C) So the concat() method above is almost working like a push() .

D) the concat() is being invoked on each addition of the number elements from each of the nested inner array.

E) And only after all the

Here's how its working here with each iteration on the first element of the outer array.

[].concat(1+2)  // [3]
[3].concat(2 + 2) // [3, 4]
[3, 4].concat(3 + 1) // [3, 4, 4]

And once this first element of the outer array is executed, it pushes the final concatenated array to 'result' variable and moves to the next inner array numbers.
