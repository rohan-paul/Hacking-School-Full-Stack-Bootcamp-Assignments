Problem statement - I have a list of files in the ./files directory, where I have a list of corrupted files where the file contents are duplicated, one paragraph after another.

Use Node.js to truncate each files in half. That is each the file size should be half its current size so the the 2 paragraphs are not duplicated any more.
