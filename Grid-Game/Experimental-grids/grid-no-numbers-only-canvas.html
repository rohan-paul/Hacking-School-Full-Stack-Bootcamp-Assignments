The fillStyle property sets or returns the color, gradient, or pattern used to fill the drawing.

The rect() method creates a rectangle.
x	The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle
y	The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle
width	The width of the rectangle, in pixels
height	The height of the rectangle, in pixels

HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() method returns a drawing context on the canvas. contextType
Is a DOMString containing the context identifier defining the drawing context associated to the canvas. Possible values are:
"2d", leading to the creation of a CanvasRenderingContext2D object representing a two-dimensional rendering context.

beginPath() and closePath() - beginPath() clears the old path so you can define a new one.

closePath() connects the first point with the last point.  You may not notice its effect when using fill, but when using stroke, it will (essentially) do a line back to the starting position, ‘closing’ the path.
